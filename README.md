# Cisco Packet Tracer – Network Simulation Project

This repository contains a series of structured network simulation activities completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The work is part of a university-level Computer Networks course and demonstrates practical understanding of core networking concepts, protocols, and configurations.

Authored by **Komron Maxmudov**, junior student at **Inha University in Tashkent**.

## Project Overview

The project consists of 10 individual lab activities simulating real-world network setups and services. Each activity includes a detailed configuration of devices, testing procedures, and validation through Packet Tracer. All simulations are documented in a LaTeX-based report.

## LaTeX Report

The final report includes:

- Concept overview and objectives per activity
- Step-by-step simulation procedures
- Configuration details and testing outcomes
- Logical and physical network topologies
- ACL and VLAN planning
- Cost estimation and requirement mapping (Activity 10)

All documentation is formatted using LaTeX and designed for academic presentation.
